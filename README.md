# Capteur de pression projet transverse 2a
## Description
A project to improve data acquisition software developed in JavaScript. This software, designed by Air Liquide and the Itodys laboratory, is used to measure pressure in sleep apnoea patients using a PCB (printed circuit board) and pressure sensors. The software interface was initially complex, so I developed a Python executable from the source code to simplify the process of printing the sensors. In addition, I enhanced the software by adding an interactive heat map diagram to visualise live variations in electrical capacitance.
